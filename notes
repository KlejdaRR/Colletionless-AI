The whole process starts with the calling of the run_experiment() function of the Experiments class.

When calling this method the following processes are being executed:

1. An object of the Classroom() class is created with:

-- a number of students
-- a window size for the conservation of the losses
-- a set number of intervals for when to evaluate on the validation dataset for the best student
-- the size of the validation dataset

What happens inside the Classroom() initialization:

-- 8 Student neural networks are created, each with random initial weights
-- 8 Adam optimizers are created (one for each student)
-- 1 Teacher is created with 1000 teaching "calls"
-- Loss history queues are initialized for each student (to track last 100 losses)
-- Initial phase is set to "teacher_phase"
-- History tracking dictionary is prepared for storing accuracies

2. The datasets are retrieved (one for training and one for validation) with respectively 64 batch size and
100 batch size.

3. The function setup_validation_batches() of the Classroom() class is called in order to set up the validation
dataset's batches which will be used to find the best student every 200 steps.

What happens inside setup_validation_batches():

-- Extracts 5 batches from the validation dataloader
-- Stores them in a list called self.validation_batches
-- These batches are FIXED and will be used every time we need to find the best student
-- This ensures consistent evaluation across different steps

4. The loop is started containing 5000 steps, where for each step the inputs and the true values are retrieved
from the training dataset and along with the current number of the step and are fed to the learn_step() method
of the Classroom() class.

What happens inside learn_step(x, y_true, step):

-- Phase 4.1: Determine Learning Mode:
--- If step < 2000 AND teacher still has calls remaining: phase = "teacher_phase"
--- Otherwise: phase = "peer_phase"

-- Phase 4.2: Update Best Student (happens every 200 steps)
--- Calls find_best_student() method

--- Inside find_best_student():
---- Loops through all 8 students
---- For each student, calls evaluate_student_on_validation(i)

   ---- Inside evaluate_student_on_validation():
     ----- Student makes predictions on all 5 validation batches
     ----- Compares predictions with true labels
     ----- Calculates accuracy percentage

  ---- Returns the index of student with highest validation accuracy
-- Phase 4.3.1: Teacher-Led Learning (if phase == "teacher_phase")
--- For each of the 8 students:
---- optimizer.zero_grad() - Reset gradients
---- output = student.forward(x) - Make predictions
---- loss = F.nll_loss(output, y_true) - Calculate loss using true labels
---- loss.backward() - Calculate gradients
---- optimizer.step() - Update weights
---- Record loss in student's loss history

-- Phase 4.3.2: Peer-to-Peer Learning (if phase == "peer_phase")
--- 4.3.2.1: Best student creates "soft targets"
---- best_student_output = best_student(x) - Best student makes predictions
---- soft_targets = F.softmax(best_student_output / 2.0) - Convert to probabilities with "temperature"

--- 4.3.2.2: Other students learn from best student
---- For each non-best student:
----- student_output = student(x) - Student's own prediction
----- distillation_loss = KL_divergence(student_output, soft_targets) - Compare with best student
----- If teacher still has calls: also learn from true labels with 30% weight
----- total_loss.backward() and optimizer.step() - Update weights
----- Record loss in history

--- 4.3.2.3: Best student learns only from true labels (if teacher has calls)
---- This keeps the best student sharp while teaching others

5. The evaluation process starts and it should happen every 500 step in order to evaluate all of the students
of the class and find out if they have surpassed the best student. It is done by calling the evaluate_students()
function of the Classroom() class.

What happens inside evaluate_students(test_loader, step):

-- For each batch in the test dataset:
--- Teacher Accuracy (if teacher still has calls):
---- best_student makes predictions
---- Compare with true labels, count correct predictions

--- Best Student Accuracy:
---- best_student makes predictions
---- Compare with true labels, count correct predictions

--- Class Collective Accuracy (VOTING):
---- All 8 students make predictions on the batch
---- For each image in the batch, take the majority vote across all 8 students
---- Compare majority vote with true labels, count correct predictions

--- Breakthrough Detection:
---- If class accuracy > best student accuracy AND step > 500:
----- Record that class has surpassed best student
----- Store the step number when this happened

--- Store all accuracies in history for plotting

After 5000 steps:

-- The system checks if the collective voting (Class accuracy) surpassed the individual best student
-- Results are printed showing final accuracies
-- A plot is generated showing the learning progress over time
-- If class surpassed best student: SUCCESS - collective intelligence emerged
-- If not: The system shows that collaboration didn't beat the individual expert
